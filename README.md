## Purpose of this repo
To demonstrate what I have learned thus far using CSS and HTML in a responsive webpage that can later be updated to include information about me, updated projects and contact information.

## Languages Used:
CSS\
HTML

## Software used:
WAVE evaluation tool\
VS Code\
GitBash\
GitHub\
Wireframing website "https://app.diagrams.net/"

### Done so far:
Website matches the wireframe mockup\
When users click on the Nav links, they are taken to the corresponding section\
When users hover over the individual projects, the project section darkens slightly\
When users hover over contact info or click the github page, info is displayed or they are redirected\
When users click on the first project, they are taken to the deployed website for the Module 01 project\
Website has responsive design and items on screen adjust when the screen width is changed\
About me typed up

### TODO:
Add more projects to the portfolio\
Add updated resume to the portfolio\


### Special Thanks:
Daler Singh and Sachin J. for having taught me how to apply what we are learning with CSS and HTML into an active webpage.
